# Jill Eliceiri Individual Project

This repository will serve as an example for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

## Problem Statement
Travelers need to have important information about the places that they plan to visit. 
Sure, where you stay and how you get there are important, but also important is local health information and weather. 
Trip planner sites like Google Travel provide useful information, but it takes you to external sites for weather and health information. 
What happens if you or your loved one needs to visit a hospital for emergency services? Wouldn't it be useful to know vital information such as hospital capacity?
MyPlaces will have this current information in one useful location, along with the ability to write, view, update, and delete travel notes, which contain anything the traveler wants to store in them. MyPlaces can also save information to a file which can be printed in case of no internet connection.
