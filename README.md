### Problem Statement
Travelers need to have important information about the places that they plan to visit. Sure, where you stay and how you get there are important, but also important is local health information and weather. Trip planner sites like Google Travel provide useful information, but it takes you to external sites for weather and health information. MyPlaces will have this current information in one useful location, along with the ability to write travel notes, and it will also save it to a file to be printed in case of no internet connection.
