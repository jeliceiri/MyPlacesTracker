# Jill Eliceiri Individual Project

This repository is the individual project for the final Java course at Madison College in the Fall 2021. The project is an innovative, data-driven Java application that solves a real world problem.
## Problem Statement
Travelers need to have important information about the places that they plan to visit. 
Sure, where you stay and how you get there are important, but also important is local health information and weather. 
Trip planner sites like Google Travel provide useful information, but it takes you to external sites for weather and health information. 
What happens if you or your loved one needs to visit a hospital for emergency services? Wouldn't it be useful to know vital information such as nearby hospital ICU capacity?
MyPlaces will have this current information in one useful location, along with the ability to write, view, and edit travel notes - which contain anything the traveler wants to store in them. 
MyPlaces can also save information to a file which can be printed or viewed later in case of no internet connection.
